Briefly recap what was done.

Potential further improvements:

- more advanced architectures (point transformers maybe)
- more advanced feature extraction techniques for orthophotos (based on CNNs)
- more sophisticated sampling for trees to fill patches and more sophisticated placing algorithms that more closely mimic real dense forests

The main contribution of  this thesis is the design and experimental verification of a novel framework for detecting and describing individual trees in dense mixed forests.
