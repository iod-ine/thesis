## Area-based approach

The most common way to use LiDAR for mapping forest attributes is the area-based approach [@whiteABAGuide2013].
@fig-aba-schema shows its schematic representation.
It consists of conducting a manual forest inventory to collect ground truth data for fitting statistical models and validating the results, and a LiDAR survey covering the whole area of interest.
The inventory usually consists of many circular ground plots with every tree within counted and attributes of interest either directly measured or calculated and averaged.
The point cloud is clipped by the extents of the ground plots, and for each plot it is reduced to a collection of manually selected metrics.
The metrics usually include descriptions of the height distribution of points, but any summary statistic that can be derived from a collection of points can be used, including features mentioned in @sec-classic-machine-learning.
These metrics are then used as input features for modeling the forest attributes measured on the corresponding plots.
The same metrics are calculated for the entire area of interest, using a grid with a cell size similar in area to the area of a single ground plot.
The models are then applied to the grid, generating an extrapolation of the required attributes.
