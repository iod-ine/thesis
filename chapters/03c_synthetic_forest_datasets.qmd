## Synthetic forests generated from individual trees {#sec-synthetic-forest-dataset}

To train tree segmentation models, training data where every point is assigned to an individual tree is required. Data like that is very labor-intensive to label. An alternative way to create such data is by generating it from patches of forest with every point assigned to a tree is by combining point clouds of individual trees  into synthetc

A patch of fixed size, filled by randomly sampled trees and the ability to add overlap.

(show example patches of different size)
(show example patches colored by RGB and different false color combinations)

Each tree has features sampled from preprocessed orthophoto (multiscale basic features).

Fixed size is better than fixed number because of the scale normalization.
