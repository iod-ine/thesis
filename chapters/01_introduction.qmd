# Introduction

Forests are a crucial part of the global ecosystem.
It is an essential renewable natural resource, provided that sustainable management practices are implemented.

Managing forests responsibly and sustainably requires data on a wide variety of forest attributes, such as distribution of species, heights, ages, above ground biomass, etc.

Significantly reduce the required effort, especially in the form of the amount of field inventory data required.
Ideally, a method that doesn't require any field data at all, only for validation and quality assessment.
Match or exceed the accuracy of the area-based approach.

There is a huge variety of remote sensing data sources that have been successfully used to solve various problems in forestry applications.

Starting from the satellite observations ...
There are even many free data sources such as Sentinels (some studies of using S1 and S2, maybe even GEDI).

Higher resolution data is however only available for money, and it isn't cheap.


UAV measurements offer a good balance between the affordability, required effort, and quality of the data.
