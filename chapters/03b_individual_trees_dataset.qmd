## Individual trees dataset

The main dataset used for training the models is a collection of point clouds of individual trees extracted manually from larger UAV LiDAR point clouds.
It consists of 394 trees, 192 of which are extracted from the previously described Lysva survey, and 202 from other surveys in Perm Krai.
