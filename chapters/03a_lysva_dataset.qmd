## Lysva field inventory dataset

The main original dataset used in the study is the Lysva field inventory dataset, named by the closest town to its location.
The dataset is released into open access with an accompanying paper that describes the data in detail and provides a basic baseline for individual tree detection [@dubrovinExplorationPropertiesPoint2024].
The study area is located in Perm Krai, Russia, 86 kilometers to the east of Perm.
The dataset consists of a field inventory of 3600 trees across 10 rectangular ground plots 100 meters in lengths and 50 meters in width fully covered by a UAV LiDAR and RGB orthophoto surveys.
@fig-aba-schema shows the locations of the ground plots over the full size RGB orthophoto and a visualization of the field inventory for a single plot on top of the LiDAR point cloud.
Colored points represent trees, with different colors mapping to different species.
The point cloud is visualized as a 2D scatter plot with points colored by height (darker points are lower, brighter points are higher).

The study region for the Lysva field inventory dataset.
**Left**: The locations of field survey plot boundaries on a full-size RGB orthophoto.
Each plot is a 50 by 100 meter rectangle, with every tree within measured and recorded.
Buffered cutouts of the orthophoto come with the dataset, along with LiDAR point clouds.
**Right**: A close up of plot number 4.
Each colored point represents a single tree of a different species, on top of a point cloud colored by the value of the height of each point (lower points are dark, higher points are bright) and the same orthophoto.

The field inventory is a tabular dataset where every row represents a single tree.
@tbl-inventory-example shows a random sample of entries from the field inventory table.
Every tree is represented by a point in UTM 40N coordinate reference system (EPSG:32640).
Every tree has a species label and diameter at breast height (dbh), measured with calipers at 1.3 m from the ground at two perpendicular directions and averaged.
@fig-lysva-species-distribution shows the distribution of species in the data: the dominant species is spruce, but overall the trees are evenly split between deciduous and coniferous with seven species in total: spruce, birch, fir, aspen, tilia, alder, and willow.
Approximately 20% of the trees have height data measured during the inventory, and 10% have ages measured on core samples, shown in the table in meters and years respectively.

@tbl-lysva-plot-stats shows some descriptive statistics for each plot in the field inventory: the number of trees in the plot, average LiDAR point density in points per square meter, and dominant species type.
The overall average point density is 37 points per square meters.
Exactly half of the plots are predominantly coniferous and half are predominantly deciduous.
@fig-lysva-canopy-structure shows two of the point clouds in 3D, highlighting the differences in canopy structure complexity between predominantly deciduous and coniferous plots.
The figure highlights that the forest is indeed dense and mixed, with non-uniform, complex canopy structure.

The camera used in the orthophoto survey is Sony A6000. The resolution of the RGB orthophoto is 7 cm per pixel.

@fig-example-3d-point-cloud is a 3D visualization of the point cloud over plot number 10.

### On using intensity-based features {#sec-intensity-based-features}

Even though some sources report intensity-based features as some of the most important ones [@shiImportantLiDARMetrics2018], the features seem to me unreliable in the context of forestry because of the physics of light reflection.
There are simply too many factors that affect the amplitude of the reflected signal, which might be useful when imaging stable targets such as urban environments but become completely unpredictable on highly unstable targets such as trees: they move in the wind in the time span of a single survey, they grow in the time span between repeated surveys, the leaves and branches are angled in every possible way.
Moreover, the quality of the recorded intensities highly depends on the used sensor.
As an example, @fig-intensity-with-example shows the distribution of intensity values for every point in the Lysva dataset, and shows plot number 10 in 3D with points colored by their recorded intensity.
The distribution of intensities seems like an artifact of faulty quantization (the fact that the maximum overall value is 63 makes me suspect it is stored by the hardware using a 6-bit unsigned integer, probably an ad hoc optimization by the sensor vendor).
With this distribution in mind, it is not surprising that coloring points by their intensity values results in images that look like noise, and there is no signal to be exploited for predictive modeling.

{{< embed 03a_lysva_dataset.ipynb#fig-intensity-with-example >}}

Some sensors do provide more consistent values.
However, relying on intensity-based features limits the applicability of developed models and methods, as any such model would surely fail on data like this.
