### On using intensity as a feature

{{< embed 03a_lysva_dataset.ipynb#fig-intensity-with-example >}}

Even though some sources report it's an awesome feature, seems super unreliable because of all the physics involved.
@fig-intensity-with-example shows the distribution of intensity values for every point in the Lysva dataset, and shows an example plot in 3D colored by intensity.
It seems like noise.
